## Description

This project was built using React.js and Next.js. I developed this project to improve my front-end skills and learn how to pull from a public API.
I also wanted to learn how to read and work with JSON data that is sent by an API.

### Design

- Create a modern and simple front-end design using React.js
- Routing to different pages using Link from Next.js
- Pulled property data from BayutAPI using Axios
- React components from ChakraUI
- Responsive web design

### Features

- Users can search for different properties through filtering
- Display preview of information for each property such as company and a description
- View detailed property information such as price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, furnishing, amenities, rent or for sale
- Arrow panel of images for each property
